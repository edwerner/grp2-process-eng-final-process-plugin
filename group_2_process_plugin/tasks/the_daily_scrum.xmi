  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On each day of a sprint, the team holds daily meetings (“the daily scrum”). Meetings are typically held in the same&#xD;
    location and at the same time each day. Ideally the daily scrums are held in the morning as they help set the context&#xD;
    for the coming day's work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All team members are required to attend the daily scrum. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson, or&#xD;
    a developer from another project) is allowed to attend but is there only to listen. This makes the daily scrums an&#xD;
    excellent way for a Scrum team to disseminate status information--if you're interested in hearing where things are at,&#xD;
    attend that day's meeting. The daily scrum is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that&#xD;
    are raised are taken offline and usually dealt with by the relevant sub-group immediately after the daily scrum. During&#xD;
    the daily scrum each team member provides answers to the following three questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What did you do yesterday?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will you do today?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any impediments in your way?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today the team gains an excellent&#xD;
    understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum is not a status update meeting in which&#xD;
    a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make&#xD;
    commitments to each other. If a programmer stands up and says &quot;Today I will finish the data storage module&quot; everyone&#xD;
    knows that in tomorrow's meeting he will say whether or not he did finish. This has the wonderful effect of helping a&#xD;
    team realize the significance of these commitments and that their commitments are to each other, not to some far-off&#xD;
    customer or salesman.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical&#xD;
    issues) he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.&#xD;
