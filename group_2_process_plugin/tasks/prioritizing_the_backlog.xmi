  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of work to be completed by the team. It is continuously updated by the&#xD;
    Product Owner based on feedback from the end-user (as they are exposed to new product increments) and also in response&#xD;
    to the evolving technical and business landscape.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important that the team provides the Product Owner with sizing estimates for the Product Backlog items to enable&#xD;
    the Product Owner to balance business need with the estimated cost of implementation.&#xD;
