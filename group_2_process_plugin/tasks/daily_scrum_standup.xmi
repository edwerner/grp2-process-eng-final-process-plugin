  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On each day of a development sprint, the team holds a daily scrum meeting called the &quot;daily scrum.” Meetings are&#xD;
    typically held in the same location and at the same time each day. Ideally, a daily scrum meeting is held in the&#xD;
    morning, as it helps set the context for the coming day's work. These scrum meetings are strictly time-boxed to 15&#xD;
    minutes. This keeps the discussion brisk but relevant. [1]&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
