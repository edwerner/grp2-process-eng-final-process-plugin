  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Items on the sprint backlog are drawn from the product backlog, by the team based on the priorities set and the team's&#xD;
    perception of the time it will take to complete the various features.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is critical that the team selects the items and size of the sprint backlog. Because they are the ones committing to&#xD;
    completing the tasks they must be the ones to choose what they are committing to.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The sprint backlog is very commonly maintained as an Excel spreadsheet but it is also possible to use your defect&#xD;
    tracking system or any of a number of software products designed specifically for Scrum or agile.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the Sprint the ScrumMaster maintains the sprint backlog by updating it to reflect which tasks are completed and&#xD;
    how long the team thinks it will take to complete those that are not yet done. The estimated work remaining in the&#xD;
    sprint is calculated daily and graphed, resulting in a Sprint Burndown Chart&#xD;
