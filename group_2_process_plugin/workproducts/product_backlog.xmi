  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a project is initiated there is no comprehensive, time-consuming effort to write down all foreseeable tasks or&#xD;
    requirements. Typically, a project writes down everything obvious, which is almost always more than enough for a first&#xD;
    sprint. The Product Backlog is then allowed to grow and change as more is learned about the product and its customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the Sprint Planning Meeting the Product Owner prioritizes the items in the Product Backlog and describes them to&#xD;
    the team. The team then determines which items they can complete during the coming Sprint. The team then moves items&#xD;
    from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog. In doing they expand each Product Backlog item into one or more Sprint&#xD;
    Backlog tasks so they can more effectively share work during the Sprint. Conceptually, the team starts at the top of&#xD;
    the prioritized Product Backlog list and draws a line after the lowest of the high priority items they feel they can&#xD;
    complete. In practice it is not unusual to see a team select, for example, the top five items and then two items from&#xD;
    lower on the list but that are associated with the initial five.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product backlog items can be technical tasks (&quot;Refactor the Login class to throw an exception&quot;) or more user-centric&#xD;
    (&quot;Allow undo on the setup screen&quot;). A very interesting prospect is expressing Scrum backlog items in the form of&#xD;
    Extreme Programming's User Stories.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Backlog can be maintained in an Excel spreadsheet. An example from a real project is shown below. This&#xD;
    Excel spreadsheet shows each product backlog item assigned a general priority (Very High, High, etc.) by the Product&#xD;
    Owner. Estimates have been developed by the developers but it is understood that they are very imprecise and are useful&#xD;
    only for rough assignments of tasks into the various sprints.&#xD;
