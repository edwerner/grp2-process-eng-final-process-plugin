    Story points are probably the most commonly used estimating unit among agile teams today. The name is derived from&#xD;
    agile teams commonly expressing requirements as “user stories”. A story point is a relative estimate of the &quot;size&quot; of&#xD;
    the work compared to other work on the project. So, a 10-point user story is expected to take twice as long as a&#xD;
    5-point user story.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimates are not quantified but implicitly include the team's collective understanding of the complexity, risk and&#xD;
    time for the work being estimated. A story point is unique to the team and cannot be compared with a story point on&#xD;
    another team. It can be counter productive to map story points to their absolute time equivalent and the accepted&#xD;
    technique for predicting time to completion is the team's velocity.&#xD;
