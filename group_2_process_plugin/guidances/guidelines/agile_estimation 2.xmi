    Agile Estimation&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The three main concepts are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Estimation of Size&lt;/strong> gives a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a&#xD;
        neutral unit such as points&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Velocity&lt;/strong>&amp;nbsp;the ammount of&amp;nbsp;points&amp;nbsp;A project team can deliver within an iteration;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Estimation of Effort&lt;/strong> translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort&#xD;
        typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take&#xD;
        the team member(s) to complete the assigned work item(s).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Estimation of Size&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Points&lt;/strong> is a relative measure that can be used for agile estimation of size.&amp;nbsp;The team decides how&#xD;
    big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go fast, use&#xD;
    only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To get&#xD;
    started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through all&#xD;
    other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for high-level&#xD;
    estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower priority, to&#xD;
    avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Velocity&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an&#xD;
    iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration.&#xD;
    At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the&#xD;
    next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let's say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than&#xD;
    in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not&#xD;
    always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being&#xD;
    harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better&#xD;
    teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity&#xD;
    typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Estimation of Effort&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the&#xD;
    units of Actual Days or Actual Hours.&#xD;
